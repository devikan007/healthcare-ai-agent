            The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Symptoms typically include
            runny nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, sneezing, low-grade fever, and general malaise.
            Most colds are caused by rhinoviruses. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms while the body

            Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose).
            There are two main types: Type 1 (the body doesn't produce insulin) and Type 2 (insulin resistance).
            Symptoms may include increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, fatigue, and blurred vision.
            Management typically involves monitoring blood sugar, medication, healthy eating, and regular exercise.

            Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against artery walls
            is consistently too high. It often has no symptoms but can lead to heart disease and stroke if untreated.
            Blood pressure is measured in two numbers: systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number).
            Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg. Treatment may include lifestyle changes and medication.

            Triggers can include allergens, exercise, respiratory infections, and air pollutants.
            Treatment typically involves avoiding triggers and using medications like bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

            Some people experience an aura before the headache, which can include visual disturbances.
